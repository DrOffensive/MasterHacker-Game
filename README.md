# MasterHacker-Game

In a world where all data is stored on harddrives. Nothing is safe from a Master Hacker.
In the year 1999. As a computer-scientist gone bad. You take jobs from anonymous benefactors to steal company secrets, rig ballot boxes, falsify records, and uncover government secrets.
Maybe there is more in cyberspace than meets the eye.
